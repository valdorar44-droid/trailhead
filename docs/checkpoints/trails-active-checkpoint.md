# Trailhead Trails Active Checkpoint

Last updated: 2026-07-27 21:33 CDT (America/Winnipeg)

## Resume protocol

Read this file before every Trails work session and after any context compaction.

1. Run `git status --short --branch` in `/home/sean/.openclaw/workspace/trailhead`.
2. Verify `dashboard/explore_serving_index_v2.json` still hashes to `7e59e5e2273dbbe1a26d7bbd4d947faa20935c51fb79c464eed8a17babf4d8f4`.
3. Never stage `.cursor/`, `dashboard/explore_serving_index_v2.json`, or unrelated dirty files.
4. Continue from **Next exact packet**. Do not restart completed 1.0.10 crawls, research, or Android Auto work.

## Source and paired preview baseline

- Branch: `feat/trailhead-1.0.10-overhaul`.
- Exact pre-Trails HEAD: `023e27ebaad4bfed0a0a3b9a33bbd2c04430bbac`.
- Native build source: `08debcceff098b2e19542591a6959301ea5b5b93`.
- Android preview: build `68`, build ID `093378cc-0499-4ed7-9460-2db2e44ebe7e`, runtime `native-1.0.10-android.6`, installed on Samsung `RFCR408DA9B`.
- iOS preview: build `60`, build ID `ec7d6add-76eb-4eb0-8006-52d5654f0879`, runtime `native-1.0.10-ios.5`.
- Protected Explore index SHA-256: `7e59e5e2273dbbe1a26d7bbd4d947faa20935c51fb79c464eed8a17babf4d8f4`.
- Task-owned background processes: none.
- Open P0/P1 defects entering Trails: none. Audible confirmation for the unrelated Android Auto Co-Pilot cue is parked and is not part of Trails.

## Protected and unrelated worktree state

The following pre-existing user changes are excluded from every Trails commit:

- `.cursor/`
- `dashboard/explore_serving_index_v2.json`
- `docker/valhalla-artifact/start.sh`
- `docs/app-store-copy.md`
- `mobile/android/gradlew`
- `mobile/scripts/android-auto-dhu.sh`
- `mobile/scripts/install-maestro.sh`
- `mobile/scripts/maestro-config.test.mjs`
- `scripts/build_valhalla_artifact.sh`
- `scripts/build_valhalla_region_artifacts.sh`
- `scripts/probe_routing_50_states.py`
- `scripts/publish_valhalla_artifact.py`
- `scripts/run_nps_hourly_enrichment.py`
- `scripts/valhalla_artifact_bootstrap.py`

Verify the staged file list before every commit.

## Trails product decisions

- One unified Trail Builder supports canonical trails, tap-to-route, free drawing, GPX import, and recording.
- Activities and permitted uses appear only when source-backed. Missing facts are omitted; measured zero values remain valid.
- Trail downloads extend Offline V2 with Mapbox Outdoors and verified Trailhead trail artifacts.
- Starting away from a trail routes to a sourced trailhead before Trail Follow.
- Follow retains the compass and uses visual guidance, haptics/chimes, and optional concise voice.
- Flyovers are short, deterministic, silent, and follow the actual route on the main map.
- Back restores the exact previous trail state. Close exits the trail workflow. Active Follow or recording requires confirmation before stopping.
- Android preview and physical review precede iOS from the exact accepted SHA. Production remains a separate approval.

## T1 baseline findings

- The canonical trail index currently contains `43,296` records, while the bundled Explore geometry file contains only `7` geometries.
- Current discovery can surface raw OSM way fragments, technical road numbers, duplicate sections, partial distances, `Check access`, `Mapped route`, and a generic generated summary. T1 replaces those outputs with canonical trail systems and honest capability states.
- The existing map can identify a candidate through rendered-feature queries, but final selection must resolve the complete canonical geometry before highlighting, saving, previewing, or downloading.
- Selected geometry must remain above labels and POIs, with muted context and one restrained orange selected state. Point-only and partial records must not pretend to be complete routes.
- Exact licensed imagery is optional. When unavailable, use a real route preview or a clean text card; never substitute a generic destination photo.
- Mapbox Search remains fallback inventory for general destinations and POIs. Trailhead owns persistent trail identity and ordering.

## Packet ledger

### T1 - Canonical discovery, cards, and highlighting

- Status: design delta in progress; implementation not started.
- Scope: `TrailSystemV2`, `TrailDiscoveryItemV2`, additive v2 discovery/detail/preview APIs, canonical grouping, honest geometry status, capability-driven cards, complete-route resolution, and selected-route highlighting.
- Design gate: add discovery, complete-route, partial/point-only, overlapping-candidate, loading/empty/error, and light/dark states to the existing Figma page. Material changes require user approval before code.
- Required evidence after implementation: focused API/model tests, canonical grouping fixtures, stale A-to-B rejection, complete highlight across tile boundaries, clean copy/media fallbacks, Android device delta, then iOS from the same accepted SHA.

### T2 - Trail and trailhead sheets

- Status: pending T1 acceptance.

### T3 - Unified Trail Builder and GPX

- Status: pending T2 acceptance.

### T4 - Complete offline trail pack

- Status: pending T3 acceptance.

### T5 - Drive-to-trailhead, Follow, and recording

- Status: pending T4 acceptance; paired native candidates required.

### T6 - Simple trail flyover

- Status: pending T5 acceptance.

## Next exact packet

1. Inspect existing on-canvas components, variables, fonts, and approved trail frames in Figma.
2. Add the T1 review packet to the existing Trailhead design page without changing approved screens.
3. Render and verify the packet, record its node IDs here, and stop for user approval.
4. After approval, implement only T1, run focused tests, publish Android preview first, and stop for live Android acceptance before iOS.

## Do not repeat

- Memory Gate, Layers audit, Yellowstone city/sheet crawl, NPS research, Originals lifecycle, Android Auto crawl, store screenshots, or the broad 1.0.10 regression.
- Do not redesign approved Peek/Full sheets during T1.
- Do not start T2-T6 before the preceding packet is accepted.
- Do not add speculative modules, generic photography, invented access facts, AI labels, random pills, or display zero for missing facts.
