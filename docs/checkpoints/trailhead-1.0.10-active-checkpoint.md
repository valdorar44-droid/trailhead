# Trailhead 1.0.10 Active Checkpoint

Last updated: 2026-07-23 01:57 (America/Winnipeg)

## Resume protocol

Read this file before resuming the 1.0.10 overhaul after a restart or context compaction. Then:

1. Run `git status --short --branch` in `/home/sean/.openclaw/workspace/trailhead`.
2. Verify `dashboard/explore_serving_index_v2.json` still hashes to `7e59e5e2273dbbe1a26d7bbd4d947faa20935c51fb79c464eed8a17babf4d8f4`.
3. Keep `.cursor/` and `dashboard/explore_serving_index_v2.json` out of every implementation commit.
4. Continue from **Next exact actions** below. Do not restart the design, NPS research, automated gate, or baseline crawl.

## Source checkpoint

- Branch: `feat/trailhead-1.0.10-overhaul`
- Remote baseline before the current M1 checkpoint: `e15b8fe89c6b343bfb68b187a5cb9702ae2605fe`
- Local commits created from the verified tree:
  - `4fa0379 feat(api): harden fire and explore delivery`
  - `d44618b feat(mobile): preserve explore context and map state`
  - `e6f5811 test(release): gate preview memory and telemetry`
  - `0b14624 docs: checkpoint 1.0.10 stability work`
  - `e6468bd fix(release): verify preview identity diagnostics`
  - `4958884 fix(release): traverse every map layer card`
  - `e15b8fe test(release): harden layer carousel reset`
  - `083535008c7ccf5e2edced19ae1cde14a48095d8 fix(mobile): batch signed-in trip hydration`
  - `a67d242a0aff12698f52c2932a20edd7940f9e53 fix(mobile): pause hidden map visual work`
  - `2750138e616c76ac891d785ba391368483384072 test(release): isolate map memory diagnostics`
- Installed preview source before the M1 publication: `e15b8fe89c6b343bfb68b187a5cb9702ae2605fe`.
- The three M1 implementation commits above have passed the full pre-preview gate but have not yet been published to preview.
- Nothing has been published to production from these commits.
- Production OTA, AAB/IPA submission, public Originals rollout, advertising, and store screenshot replacement remain blocked.

## Verified completed work

- The final frozen source tree passed `npm run audit:prepreview`:
  - 761 backend tests passed.
  - Android native unit/build boundary passed.
  - Originals, Explore, adaptive NPS hubs, Viator fixture/disabled behavior, TypeScript, copy audits, image guards, telemetry/privacy policy, and whitespace checks passed.
- Backend changes now cover bounded wildfire viewport queries, fresh/stale/partial/unavailable semantics, exact-media provenance, compact derivatives, and associated regression tests.
- Mobile changes now cover bounded wildfire loading, consistent map/fire status styling, exact-place media fallbacks, adaptive NPS hub navigation/return state, and image downsampling.
- Figma NPS contract: `https://www.figma.com/design/FJUcMWAfsNyjsguCEp2dBe?node-id=757-2406`.
- NPS reference evidence is under `output/nps-reference-audit/2026-07-22/`.
- Backend compatibility deployment `99dbcd8f-f0ca-417d-9123-fd812d5ae384` succeeded on Railway from the immutable source above. `https://api.gettrailhead.app/api/health` returned `200`, and the bounded fire query plus Explore catalog/home endpoints were verified live.
- Paired preview OTA published successfully from the same immutable source with Sentry source maps:
  - Preview channel ID: `019dbc97-3cde-795b-a35d-e6aa985060d3`.
  - Candidate branch: `preview-candidate-0b146242bfbed7fad8310beefc26b6a4e61eeeb0-mrwylb7f-ea5a0195e25ed95d0ed9b9c7`.
  - Android runtime `native-1.0.10-android.1`, group `db674e38-39ec-4a84-918a-5da5457c0587`, update `019f8d10-53f3-7635-932f-93b042500bad`.
  - iOS runtime `native-1.0.10-ios.1`, group `20cf645a-890f-4834-b813-949268db5c97`, update `019f8d10-53f3-7978-b181-53a8350ab8e8`.
- A later paired `e15b8fe` preview is the installed stability candidate:
  - Android runtime `native-1.0.10-android.1`, group `e257a397-9eeb-460a-a9ec-4f387f810a6b`, update `019f8d69-ce9f-78fd-84f4-588f6ca721f3`.
  - iOS runtime `native-1.0.10-ios.1`, group `1f1a2d7a-b7af-4f64-bdba-da56e3a4be0f`, update `019f8d69-ce9f-7c16-bf35-2e9ac861fcf4`.
- The user manually verified that the full Layers sheet works on both Android and iPhone. The earlier automated missing-layer result was a carousel traversal false positive, not a product regression. Do not reopen Layers as a defect without new evidence.
- The exact `e15b8fe` Samsung memory gate failed the strict baseline before layer cycles with samples `938399`, `980191`, and `896221` KB. Evidence: `/tmp/trailhead-deploy-0b14624/output/android-map-memory-gate/2026-07-23T05-21-05-616Z/report.json`.
- Read-only isolation proved the cold signed-in Explore process can climb above 1 GB without mounting Map. The primary evidence-backed cause was repeated per-record trip-repository hydration, with every item reserializing, rereading, and reparsing the complete account state.
- M1 now batches each remote repository page into one transaction, rolls back failed reads/writes, emits one committed snapshot, and records count/byte-only QA diagnostics. The QA screen no longer parses full legacy offline place packs.
- Retained Map tabs now keep semantic state mounted while pausing hidden visual sources, viewport work, image work, and stale async commits. One coordinator deduplicates native region events against the refocus fallback; navigation and Originals runtimes remain independent.
- The memory gate now fails fast above the baseline threshold, restores captured layer choices durably, retries only a verified persisted-state mismatch once, and records primary and restoration failures separately.
- The complete post-M1 `npm run audit:prepreview` run passed on 2026-07-23: native/config drift, Android Auto debug unit boundary, Search V2, Offline V1/V2 preservation, Explore/NPS/Viator/copy/privacy checks, TypeScript, and all 761 backend tests.

## Existing crawl evidence — do not repeat as baseline work

- 33 Android audit runs.
- 240 Trailhead Android screenshots and 219 UI hierarchy dumps.
- 10 Maestro runs covering warm Map/search and related flows.
- Android Auto evidence under `output/android-auto/`.
- NPS reference crawl: 103 UI hierarchy dumps and 94 PNGs including Figma exports.
- Existing Trailhead runs cover onboarding, Explore pagination/stress, Map/search, layers/weather, sheet/review paths, navigation, Samsung captures, and emulator flows.
- The installed evidence candidate is Android 1.0.10 build 59 with runtime `native-1.0.10-android.1`; several runs are tied to OTA/source SHA `90b8124`, while earlier emulator runs are tied to `b0c7696`.

## Known unresolved blockers

- The M1 fixes have not yet been published or installed. Device acceptance must use one paired preview OTA from one immutable SHA.
- The corrected Samsung memory gate must prove total PSS below `512000` KB and median growth below 10% over ten heavy-layer cycles. The `e15b8fe` failure remains authoritative until the M1 candidate passes.
- Only after that pass should the affected Android delta crawl and iOS shared spot-check run. Do not repeat the 33 baseline crawls.
- EAS preview credentials for Branch, Sentry, Google Maps, and RNMapbox were verified without exposing their values before publication.
- Branch deferred handoff stays disabled until branded-domain TLS and fresh-install attribution pass.

## Next exact actions

1. Commit this checkpoint without staging `.cursor/` or `dashboard/explore_serving_index_v2.json`, then push the intentional M1 commit series.
2. Publish one paired preview OTA from that immutable SHA through the guarded publisher with Sentry source maps.
3. Verify exact build/runtime/update identity on Samsung and emulator, then run the corrected Samsung memory gate first.
4. If memory passes, run only the affected delta crawl: warm Map/Explore returns, search/keyboard retention, layers/fire/styles/filters/legends, NPS list-detail-map-back, exact-place imagery, and sheet identity.
5. Repeat the shared delta on iOS and assemble the M1 review packet. Stop before M2 until the packet is reviewed.

## Checkpoint maintenance

Update this file after each commit, deployment, preview publication, or device gate. Record exact SHAs and artifact IDs. Keep completed work in place so a future session can distinguish reusable evidence from tests that truly need to be repeated.
